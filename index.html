<h2> Welcome to My Webpage filled with Animals!</h2>

<p>
Animals have been a comfort to me ever since. Animals are a vast and fascinating group of living organisms that share some key characteristics. They are multicellular eukaryotes, meaning their cells have a nucleus and are organized into tissues and organs. Most animals are mobile, allowing them to search for food, escape danger, and find mates.

<p>
This incredible animal web boasts a mind-boggling diversity. From the towering giants like giraffes to the microscopic plankton in the oceans, animals have adapted to thrive in every corner of the planet, from the scorching deserts to the freezing poles.
